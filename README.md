# Java Exercises 

This repository contains a set of Java Classes with simple exercises. The classes implement simple functions for string manipulation, math puzzles, elemental algorithms and computer science fundamentals exercises. These classes can be used to learn Java and to practice CS fundamentals. Each main class implements a set of functions and subclasses to practice basic concepts and the use of Arrays, For Loops, HashMaps, Trees, Stacks, Queues, etc. Many exercises and examples here are implentation and modification of coding problems from the Book Craking the Code Interview, by Gayle Laakmann.

### Classes

* **StringExercises.java** - Simple string manipulation and puzzels.
* **MathExercises.java** - Simple math, matrixes and numbers manipulation.
* **Node.java** - Singled Linked List Implementation in Java.
* **LinkedListSample.java** Sample of LinkedList users.
* **Stack.java** Stack implementation using LinkedList.
* **ArrayStack.java** Stack implementation using Array.
* **MinStack.java** Stack that keeps minimum value reference.
* **Queue.java** Simple Queue implementation using LinkedList.
* **MyQueue.java** Queue implemented with two stacks.
* **StacksQueuesSample.java** Sample usage of Stacks & Queues.
* **AnimalShelter.java** Sample usage of Queues.
* **TreesSample.java** Tree implementation and usage, creation, binanrySearchTree, balancing trees, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and traversals (pre-order, in-oder & post-order).
* **GraphsSample.java** GraphNode implementation and graph routing algorithm (BFS).


Feel free to use this examples for any purposes.
